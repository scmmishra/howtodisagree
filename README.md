# how to disagree

Let's accept this, the internet is not a healthy place for discourse. The world is more polarized than it ever was, it now is easier to put your thoughts out to the world than it ever was, we all live behind the glass walls of our laptop, tablet and smartphone screens providing us a mostly false notion of anonymity. This has made web a very toxic place for discussions, especially if there is disagreemet.
